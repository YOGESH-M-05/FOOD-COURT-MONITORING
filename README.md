# FOOD-COURT-MONITORING
- I made a simple food court monitoring webpage as a beginner.
- YOGA Kitchen is a web-based order management system designed to help restaurant owners track new and past orders efficiently.
- The Order History page displays previous orders with details such as order ID, customer name, food items, quantity, and status.
- Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project ensures a responsive user experience.
- Future enhancements may include backend integration, user authentication, and advanced filtering options.
- The system also aims to provide seamless navigation across different sections, allowing users to manage orders with ease.
- By implementing a structured and modular approach, YOGA Kitchen enhances order tracking, improves operational efficiency, and lays the foundation for further scalability and feature expansion.
